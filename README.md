Team Agnes presents: EasyDocs - A student friendly Machine learning application like no other.
A convenient app for all your study needs: from document/text summarization to text-to-speech to OCR, we've got you covered ;)

Choose from 6 unique components:-
1. Summarize hyper-links to various Wikipedia pages, blogs or any page with textual content.

2. Summarize any text document and save yourself the time and effort put into reading your lecture notes or articles.

3. Convert the text in any image into a copy-paste friendly format without spending a dime! Ta-dah welcome to the OCR section.

4. Feed text to EasyDocs and watch it get magically get converted into an audio file that you can play in the click of a button!

5. Upload an entire PDF file and get it read out in your own pace(select 'yes' for slower pace) and download the file to listen to it on the go!

6. Ooof! Too much information about the app right? Worry not! EzPz, the beloved EasyDocs chatbot, comes to the rescue with clear cut instructions as to what each module is used for and how they all work.
